            <img class="portrait" src="../images/portrait.jpg" alt="Picture of me">
            <p>I am Elio Tannous, a recent graduate from the University of Pittsburgh, where I obtained a degree 
                in Digital Narrative &amp; Interactive Design (DNID) and a minor in Computer Science. As a creative 
                problem solver, I'm excited to transition from my academic journey into the professional world, where
                I aim to apply my diverse skill set to real-world challenges.
            </p><br>
            <p>During my time on campus, I had the opportunity to fully immerse myself in the college setting. Therefore,
                in addition to excelling academically, I had the opportunity to improve my personal and social skills.
                Now, I continue to live in the Pittsburgh area. However, I reallocated to Glenshaw, which is still very close to
                the vibrant city I've come to know and and love!
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Beyond academics, I maintain a diverse range of hobbies. Whether I'm perfecting my jump rope technique, 
                playing an intense game of pickleball, diving into the world of cinema, or simply enjoying quality time with friends.
                I'm always eager to explore new interests and experiences.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Described by others as confident, friendly, and reliable, I'm dedicated to making meaningful connections and contributions
                in both my personal and professional life. I look forward to connecting with you and discovering how we can collaborate and
                create together.
            </p>
